                            Naomi came on board for a challenging development project with a renowned fashion designer - she helped carve out the creative and production plans, she then reached out to her immense broadcast and streamer contact list to gather interest. She is personable, extremely efficient and met delivery dates with ease.

                            Naomi was an excellent partner during the filming for 'Swiped'. She is extremely organised and caring on a project with many moving parts, whilst taking care of our students and their families best interests. She was respectful of the school environment at all times and the staff and community had a great experience working with her team. We couldn't have asked for a better production experience.
